# Azure Machine Learning: Automobile Price Prediction

## Overview
I built a regression model to predict automobile prices using Azure Machine Learning Designer.

## Learning from this 
- Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
- Set up compute clusters for model training
- Explore and transform the dataset for optimal results
- Train a regression model to predict automobile prices
- Evaluate the model's performance using key metrics
- Create an inference pipeline for real-time price prediction
- Deploy the trained model as a web service using Azure Container Instance

## Prerequisites
- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts (optional)
- No prior coding experience required

## Steps to Follow
1. **Set Up Azure ML Workspace**  
   - Navigate to Azure Portal and create an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
   - Configure and set up necessary resources.

2. **Prepare the Compute Environment**  
   - Set up compute clusters to train the model efficiently.

3. **Load and Explore Data**  
   - Import the automobile dataset and perform data preprocessing.

4. **Build and Train the Regression Model**  
   - Use Azure ML Designer to create a regression model for price prediction.

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - Assess the modelâ€™s performance using key evaluation metrics.

6. **Deploy the Model**  
   - Deploy the trained model as a web service using Azure Container Instance.
   - Create an endpoint for real-time predictions.

7. **Test the Deployment**  
   - Send sample data to the deployed model and verify the predictions.
